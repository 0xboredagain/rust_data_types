### Data Types
Every value in Rust is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data. 
Weâ€™ll look at two data type subsets: scalar and compound.

### Scalar Types
A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.

### Compound Types
Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.
